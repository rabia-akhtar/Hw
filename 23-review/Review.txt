Project I am reviewing: Not PvZ 
https://github.com/RyanTu/APCS-FallProject

General

Gui.java does not have much going on so far. I see that you guy have made the grid that reacts to a mouse using 
mouselistener and the code is pretty self explanatory. Besides the grid and counter, the game has not really manifested itself. As a major suggestion, 
I suggest you guys pick up your pace considering how we are nearing the deadline for this project. 


Documentation

Obviously, not many people have started their documenation yet so later on definately  
add comments into your code and flesh out your read me file.
