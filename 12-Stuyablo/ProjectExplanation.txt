This group consists of me (Rabia Akhtar), Max Fishelson, Sammi Wu Leung, and Thomas Wong.
We created a game modeled after Avatar: The Last Airbender where the user picks what type 
of bending they use and has to use a good strategy in order to win. Our code utilizes inheritence
and encounter is our most important subclass, as it handles most of the game. We would like to expand
and improve on this project as we move forward.
